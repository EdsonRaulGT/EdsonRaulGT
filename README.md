## Hi there 👋

I'm **Edson Gómez**, a **Ph.D. student in Oceanography** at the **University of Concepción, Chile**.

I hold a **B.Sc. and Professional Title in Biology** from the **National University of San Marcos** and an **M.Sc. in Marine Sciences** from **Cayetano Heredia University**, both obtained in Peru.

I have participated in several oceanographic cruises organized by the **Instituto del Mar del Perú (IMARPE)**, as well as specialized courses in oceanographic data science, workshops, conferences, and research internships.

My scientific interest focuses on the comprehensive study of the ocean, with emphasis on:

- 🌊 **Biogeochemical processes**  
- 🌱 **Marine productivity**  
- 🧪 **Pollution and environmental stressors**  
- 🐚 **Benthic ecology**  
- 🫧 **Dynamics of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ)**  
- 🧬 **Marine biodiversity**  

More broadly, my purpose is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the **mechanisms that regulate the oceanic biological pump**.
